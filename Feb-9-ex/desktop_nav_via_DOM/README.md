I need to populate a header on the browser window using the DOM and Javascript (NO HTML ALLOWED). The header should contain the following items:

Home, Portfolio, About, Contact &
Privacy Policy

Once the header is in the DOM, I need to style it using the CSS Flexbox module and other CSS properties. 

Furthermore, the `Home` item must be proportiantely larger than the remaining items of the header. 

The final constraint is that my header must be identical to the image titled `replicateThisHeader` in the `images` directory of this repo.
