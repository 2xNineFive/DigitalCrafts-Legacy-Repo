# Javasscript Data 103 

## The data types `null`  && `undefined`

### `null`
```
let captainName = null; 
console.log=(captainName) --> null
```


### `undefined`
```
let captainName; 
console.log=(captainName) --> null
<!-- this isn't assigning anything!!! -->
```

`null` && `udefineed` are both data types and values! <br>
I also learned that I can type `node` in the `CLI` to write and test `JS`. <br>
You can exit with `.exit`.
