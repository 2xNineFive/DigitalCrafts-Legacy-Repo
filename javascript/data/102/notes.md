# Javascript Data 102 
## Three Simple Data Types 



### String 
A string is defined with `' '` or `" "`.
```
let location = "Coachella, CA";
```

### Boolean
The value of a boolean is either `true` or `false`.
```
const isOld = false;
<!-- the 'is' is a convention for indicating a boolean -->
<!-- a boolean can be set to either true or fa -->
```

### Number 
This data type literally deals with `Numbers`. BUT there is another data type for extremely large numbers. 
```
let age = 21;
```
