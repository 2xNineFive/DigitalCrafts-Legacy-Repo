# HTML 101

## HTML forms the structures of all web pages.

HTML -> hyper-text markup language 

The `<head>` tag configures the page and is not rendered by the browser. 
The `<title>` tag(s) contain the name of the of the page and is rendered in the browsers tab. <br />
Tags that have opening and closing elements are known as container elements. <br />
Tags that do not have opening and closing elements are called self-closing tags. <br />
To make reading an HTML file easier, lines are nested within their parent element. <br />
Browsers read HTML and in a sense, HTML is like a big, long string. <br />
Browsers can read files or you can start a server in VS Code with **Go Live**. <br />
